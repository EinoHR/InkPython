## What works
* Assigning global variables
* Knots and diverts
* Variables inside text (not fully, causing some issues)
* Almost playable example script (changing variables and the end screen are somehow broken)

## Considerations
* None yet
## TODO
* Python module (on it)
    * Example script (on it) and discord bot using it
