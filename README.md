## What works
* Diverts (Only inside choices or at start, not inside knots without choices)
* Knots (not everything that can be placed inside of one)
* Choices (Non-varying)
* Variables (Can be changed inside of Ink, Cannot do math, No alternatives)

## Considerations
* Currently two empty lines must be left at the end of the file for technical reasons
