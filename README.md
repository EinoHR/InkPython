## What works
* Diverts
* Knots
* Choices (Non-varying)
* Variables (Basic maths, No "Variable text")

## Considerations
* Currently two empty lines must be left at the end of the file for technical reasons
* Multi-line comments don't work yet, instead use '//' in the front of every line of the multi-line comment.

## TODO
* Python module
    * Example script and discord bot using it
